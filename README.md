# Kickstarting with Excel 

## Overview of Project

### Purpose: To showcase data to Louise to help educate her on how her play 'Fever' and it's respective fundraising goal compares to other campaigns in relation to launch dates and their fundraising goals. The results should help get a good sense of how she compares to similar campaigns based on two pieces of criteria, Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  Outcomes based on Launch Date

  Through a line graph that was generated it is fair to see two conclusions when it comes to launching a Kickstarter for plays and their respective launch dates. The first conclusion, Kickstarter's that begin in May and June see a substantial increase in successful campaigns compared to any other time periods. A number of factors could potentially help explain this trend. For example, perhaps theatregoers become more interested in upcoming plays during this time due to increased free-time or they have increased capabilities to help fund projects but without additional research it would be difficult to pinpoint why this is the case. 

  The final related conclusion , cancelled projects do not show much trends in relation to dates they were launched. That lack of a trend can help support the fact that canceled goals probably are tied more so due to unrealistic financial based goals that were set and/or lack of interest from potential funders rather than the time cancelled campaigns were created. Very interesting to say the least! 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  Similarly to the Launch Date, a line graph was used to visually showcase trends but this time using the financial goals themselves to see if any trends can be spotted for play-based Kickstarter campaigns. One conclusion that is present is the idea that the loftier your financial based goals are, the least likely you are to have a successful Kickstarter campaign. Through the graph we can see that goals of $45,000 and higher see a high percentage of failed campaigns as a result. On the flip side of this though, we can see for successful campaigns, a range of campaigns where goals were lower then $5,000 had the highest percentage of successful Kickstarter campaigns which is interesting to see. 

  The final conclusion though highlights how campaigns that were sitting between $35,000 to $44,999 have a reasonably decent chance to be funded. In other words, the downward trend that takes place for the initial 2/3rds of the chart see a sudden uptick when the percentage of successful campaigns reach that monetary range. This data can potentially help further analyze what factors led to campaigns in those loftier ranges to either succeed around the approximate 65% of successful campaigns and 35% of failed campaigns whether it is incentives tied to funding or subject matter of the plays themselves to name a few potential outlets for expansion.  

- Limitations of the Dataset

  I have alluded to some limitations of this dataset through the conclusions that were reached like the lack of differentiating factors like the inability to pinpoint why May and June see a higher trend of successful campaigns compared to other months or the inability to differentiate reasons why some campaigns around a $35,000 to $44,999 succeeded or failed. However, it is appropriate to point out that a lot of qualitative data that can be analyzed is missing from this analysis like our inability so show how different genres might hold more public interest, different factors for funders themselves can effect monetary goals (More wealth to spend during specific timeframes, interest in plays that are based in established IP's vs Original Works etc.). An extension of this data with a qualitative data could help give even more detailed conclusions when it comes to Play-based Kickstarter campaigns and the current landscape they are contained in both through the platform and potential funders. 

- Possible Tables/Graphs to explore analyzing 

  I can think of two different tables that could help showcase some more interesting trends. For example, a table showcasing successful/failed Play-based campaigns based on region could be interesting to explore in detail if Louise ever planned on touring internationally for her play and getting a good sense if other campaigns in different regions could make that a reality. Another table that would be interesting to take a look at is one I alluded to before with a collection of data that explores how different genres of plays fared when it comes to getting their monetary goals or not. It would further give detail into what potential funders would be more interested in supporting compared to other genres. Both of these tables since they are relatively simple tally based outcomes can have a Bar Graph showcasing the most popular region/genre which would easily help get a good idea of what the answer is.
